# MusicMatchmaker
Created a recommendation system for music utilizing a custom Natural Language Processing model.  
Preprocessed and analyzed song lyrics using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to generate song recommendations based on user preferences.  
Integrated this model into a Flask application, enhancing user experience by providing direct Spotify links to the recommended songs.  

# Installation and Running of Application

Create a developer account on spotify and copy the api keys to .env file  
Generate model .pkl files by unzipping spotifySongData.zip and running the jupyter file
